# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API fetch. The `DataFetch.js` file contains the buggy code, while `DataFetchSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The application fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint. While the data fetch is successful (as confirmed by the disappearance of the ActivityIndicator), the FlatList remains blank.  This is a subtle bug related to how data updates are handled within the component's lifecycle.

## Solution

The issue is addressed by ensuring the data is correctly updated and available when the FlatList renders. The solution file demonstrates a more robust way to handle this situation, including error handling.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app.
